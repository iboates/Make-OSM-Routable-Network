<h3>Make OSM Routable Network</h3>

<p>This is a Python-based QGIS plugin that offers a visual interface for the osm2pgrouting tool.  It can read local OSM
files, or download regions from Geofabrik.  A bounding box may also be applied, which is created by osmosis.  The result
 is a series of tables in a specified database that is compatible with pgRouting, the PostGIS extension for
PostgreSQL.</p>
